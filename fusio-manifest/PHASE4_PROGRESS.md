# Phase 4 Implementation Progress

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

### âœ… Completed

1. **Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**
   - Marked Phase 2 as COMPLETED with full deliverables
   - Marked Phase 3 as COMPLETED (via comprehensive sweep)
   - Added Phase 4 section with detailed plan
   - Documented 96-config comprehensive sweep approach

2. **Added Tracking Structures to metrics.rs**
   - `WriteRecord` - tracks successful writes (writer_id, key, value, timestamp)
   - `ReadRecord` - tracks read observations (reader_id, snapshot_txn_id, key, value, timestamp)
   - Added to `MetricsCollector`: `successful_writes`, `reader_observations`
   - Added methods: `record_successful_write()`, `record_read_observation()`, `get_write_records()`, `get_read_records()`

3. **Modified client.rs to track writes and reads** âœ…
   - Updated `MockClient::run_write_transaction()` to call `metrics.record_successful_write()` after successful commits
   - Updated `MockClient::run_read_transaction()` to call `metrics.record_read_observation()` for each read
   - Captures key, value, and snapshot txn_id from all operations

4. **Added verify_serializable_isolation_with_tracking() to performance_test.rs** âœ…
   - Implemented Option B verification:
     - Verifies all successful writes appear in final state (or were overwritten later)
     - Checks readers only saw committed states (causal consistency)
     - Validates monotonic reads per reader
   - Uses tracking data from `MetricsCollector`
   - Returns detailed verification report

5. **Updated test_comprehensive_sweep with per-batch verification** âœ…
   - After each batch of 8 tests, selects one manifest to verify
   - Calls `verify_serializable_isolation_with_tracking()` on selected manifest
   - Continues even if verification fails (logs warning, doesn't abort)
   - Added metrics() getter to WorkloadDriver

6. **Added get_best_config_from_csv() to utils.rs** âœ…
   - Parses `comprehensive_sweep.csv`
   - Finds row with minimum `precondition_failure_rate`
   - Returns `WorkloadConfig` from that row
   - Handles missing files gracefully

7. **Implemented chaos injection in chaos.rs** âœ…
   - Full implementation with actual chaos scenarios:
     - `NetworkLatency`: Uses `tokio::time::sleep()` delays (50ms, 100ms, 200ms)
     - `CpuOverload`: Spawns `num_threads` tasks running busy loops at `utilization_pct` (2/4 threads, 50/80%)
     - `Combined`: Both network latency + CPU overload (100ms + 2 threads @ 50%)
   - ChaosController with start/stop lifecycle management
   - 7 scenarios total (baseline + 6 chaos variations)

8. **Added test_chaos_sweep() to performance_test.rs** âœ…
   - Loads best config from comprehensive_sweep.csv
   - Creates 7 chaos scenarios using `create_chaos_scenarios()`
   - Runs each for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
   - Tracks writes/reads for each scenario
   - Verifies isolation for each using enhanced tracking
   - Exports to `chaos_sweep.csv`
   - Provides summary and visualization command

9. **Added chaos plotting to plot_results.py** âœ…
   - New function: `plot_chaos_sweep()`
   - 6 comprehensive plots:
     - Failure rate bar chart with baseline reference
     - Write TPS bar chart with baseline reference
     - Write latency distribution (p50/p95/p99)
     - Failure rate degradation vs baseline
     - TPS degradation vs baseline
     - Read latency distribution (p50/p95/p99)
   - Color-coded by scenario type (green=baseline, orange=network, red=cpu, purple=combined)
   - Auto-detects chaos CSV files

10. **Tested compilation and fixed errors** âœ…
    - Fixed `value.cloned()` â†’ `value` in client.rs
    - Added missing `metrics()` getter to WorkloadDriver
    - Full compilation successful with only benign warnings
    - All tests compile successfully
    - End-to-end implementation complete

## Next Steps - Ready to Run Tests! ðŸš€

**Phase 4 implementation is complete. You can now run the chaos tests:**

1. **First, run the comprehensive sweep** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cargo test -p fusio-manifest --test performance_test test_comprehensive_sweep -- --ignored --nocapture
   ```
   This will:
   - Run 96 configuration combinations in parallel
   - Take ~20-25 minutes
   - Verify serializable isolation per batch
   - Generate `comprehensive_sweep.csv` and `comprehensive_sweep.png`

2. **Then, run the chaos sweep**:
   ```bash
   cargo test -p fusio-manifest --test performance_test test_chaos_sweep -- --ignored --nocapture
   ```
   This will:
   - Load the best config from comprehensive sweep
   - Run 7 chaos scenarios (5 minutes each = ~35 minutes)
   - Verify isolation for each scenario
   - Generate `chaos_sweep.csv` and `chaos_sweep.png`

3. **Analyze the results**:
   - Review the CSV files for raw data
   - Check the PNG plots for visual analysis
   - Look for isolation violations in test output
   - Compare baseline vs chaos scenario performance

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Option B Verification?

**Option A (final state only):** Fast but misses isolation violations during test
**Option B (track & verify after):** Good balance - tracks observations, validates afterward
**Option C (real-time validation):** Most thorough but complex and slows tests

**Chose Option B because:**
- High confidence in detecting violations
- Minimal performance impact (just recording)
- Can analyze patterns after test completes
- Easier to implement than real-time validation

### Why Per-Batch Verification for Comprehensive Sweep?

**Per-test (96 verifications):** Too slow, unnecessary
**Per-batch (12 verifications):** Good sampling, reasonable overhead
**Final only (1 verification):** Too risky, might miss issues

**Chose per-batch because:**
- Verify ~12.5% of tests (good sample size)
- Catch issues early without major slowdown
- One verification per batch of 8 parallel tests

### Why 5 Minutes for Chaos Tests?

**60 seconds (like Phase 3):** Too short to stress-test
**5 minutes:** Long enough to reveal stress patterns
**10+ minutes:** Diminishing returns, too slow for 7 scenarios

## Files Modified

1. `tests/perf_test/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Updated status
2. `tests/perf_test/metrics.rs` - Added tracking structures

## Files Still To Modify

3. `tests/perf_test/client.rs` - Add tracking calls
4. `tests/performance_test.rs` - Add verification function, update tests
5. `tests/perf_test/utils.rs` - Add best config selector
6. `tests/perf_test/chaos.rs` - Implement chaos injection
7. `plot_results.py` - Add chaos visualization

## Estimated Remaining Work

- **Code changes:** ~200-300 lines
- **Testing:** 1-2 hours
- **Debugging:** 1-2 hours
- **Documentation:** 30 minutes

**Total:** ~4-6 hours of focused work

## Current Code Compiles

âœ… Yes - only added new structures, didn't break existing code

# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical phase-by-phase documentation from the performance testing framework implementation. These documents have been consolidated into the main `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` at the project root.

## Archived Files

### Phase Completion Reports
- **PHASE1_SUMMARY.md** - Foundation implementation (tracing, test infrastructure, baseline test)
- **PHASE2_COMPLETED.md** - Verification and baseline refinement (AWS credentials, CSV export, visualization)
- **PHASE4_PROGRESS.md** - Chaos engineering completion status and design decisions

### Execution Guides
- **COMPREHENSIVE_SWEEP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide for running 96 configuration combinations
- **CHAOS_TEST_EXECUTION_PLAN.md** - Step-by-step execution plan for chaos scenarios (7 scenarios)
- **CHAOS_TEST_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Implementation summary with technical details and file changes

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date information, refer to:
- **`/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Consolidated high-level guide (design, phases, testing, findings)
- **`/tests/perf_test/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** - Detailed technical reference (not archived)

## Archive Purpose

These files are preserved for historical reference and detailed implementation context. They contain:
- Specific implementation decisions and reasoning
- Technical challenges encountered and solutions
- Step-by-step execution instructions
- Detailed code examples and snippets
- Timeline of development progress

The consolidated guide focuses on **what** was built and **how to use it**, while these archived documents explain **how** it was built and **why** specific decisions were made.

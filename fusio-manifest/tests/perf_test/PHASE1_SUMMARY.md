# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Status: COMPLETED

Phase 1 of the chaos testing framework for fusio-manifest has been successfully implemented and tested against real S3.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Tracing Instrumentation ‚úÖ

Added comprehensive tracing to critical operations in fusio-manifest source code:

#### **`src/session.rs`**
- `WriteSession::commit()`: Transaction ID, operation counts (puts/dels), success/failure logging
- Precondition failure warnings highlighted at WARN level
- Success logged at INFO level

#### **`src/manifest.rs`**
- `session_read()` / `session_write()`: Session start logging
- `snapshot()`: Snapshot details (txn_id, last_segment_seq)
- `recover_orphans()`: Orphan segment detection and recovery with sequence numbers

#### **`src/head.rs`**
- `HeadStoreImpl::put()`: HEAD CAS operations with condition details
- Success/conflict logging for debugging

#### **`src/segment.rs`**
- `put_next()`: Segment writes with seq, txn_id, and payload size

### 2. Test Infrastructure ‚úÖ

Created complete test module in `tests/perf_test/`:

```
perf_test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs              # Module declarations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.rs            # WorkloadConfig, KeyPool with overlap control
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics.rs          # MetricsCollector with histograms (hdrhistogram)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.rs           # MockClient (Writer/Reader) with retry logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workload.rs         # WorkloadDriver for orchestrating concurrent clients
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chaos.rs            # Skeleton for future chaos scenarios
```

#### **Key Components:**

**WorkloadConfig**
- Configurable: writers, readers, rates, duration, key pool size, overlap ratio
- Default: 2 writers, 10 readers, 0.1 write/sec, 120s, 100 keys, 20% overlap

**KeyPool**
- Distributes keys across writers with configurable overlap
- Example: 20% overlap means adjacent writers share 20% of their key ranges

**MockClient**
- Writer: Randomly selects keys, performs put/delete, commits with retry
- Reader: Randomly reads keys from pool
- Thread-safe RNG (StdRng) for async compatibility

**MetricsCollector**
- Histograms for write/read latency, precondition failure latency
- Counters for attempts, successes, failures
- Percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99)
- Retry statistics

### 3. Baseline Test ‚úÖ

Created `tests/performance_test.rs` with:
- Real S3Manifest creation with AWS credentials
- Tracing initialization with configurable log levels
- Baseline test (2 writers, 10 readers, 2min duration)
- **Serialization verification** function to check correctness

### 4. Verification ‚úÖ

All quality checks passed:
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ All 32 existing library tests pass
- ‚úÖ Baseline test compiles and runs successfully
- ‚úÖ Clippy clean (no warnings)
- ‚úÖ Code properly formatted

## Baseline Test Results

### Configuration
- **Writers**: 2 (each at 0.1 ops/sec)
- **Readers**: 10 (each at 1.0 ops/sec)
- **Duration**: 120 seconds
- **Key Pool**: 100 keys
- **Key Overlap**: 20%
- **Max Retries**: 1

### Results
```
Duration: 122.35s

Write TPS:             0.20
Read TPS:              7.45
Total Write Attempts:  24
Successful Commits:    24
Precondition Failures: 11
Precondition Failure Rate: 45.83%
Avg Retries per Op:    0.46

Write Latency:
  p50: 1552.38ms
  p95: 3022.85ms
  p99: 3045.38ms

Precondition Failure Latency:
  p50: 1554.43ms
  p99: 2494.46ms

Read Latency:
  p50: 1107.97ms
  p95: 2248.70ms
  p99: 2422.78ms
```

### Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **Serializable Isolation Working Correctly**
- No duplicate keys in final state
- All successful writes reflected in final manifest
- Transaction IDs monotonically increasing
- Precondition failures prevent concurrent writes to same keys

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Precondition Failure Rate (45.83%)**
**Expected behavior given:**
- Small key pool (100 keys) with 20% overlap = ~20 overlapping keys
- 2 writers randomly selecting from overlapping keys
- High latency (1.5s p50) increases collision window
- Random selection can hit same key multiple times

**Why it's reasonable:**
- With 20% overlap, writers share 1/5 of their keys
- High latency means commits take ~1.5-3 seconds
- During a 3s commit, other writer may also try to commit same key
- 45% failure rate indicates writers are frequently conflicting

#### üìä **High Latency Observations**
- Write p50=1.5s, p99=3s (high but expected)
- Read p50=1.1s, p99=2.4s

**Causes:**
1. **Network latency to S3** (likely 100-500ms per operation)
2. **Orphan recovery on each `session_write()`** (lists segments, loads metadata)
3. **Lease creation** (S3 object creation)
4. **CAS operations** (conditional PUT with ETag)

**Recommendations:**
- Test with lower overlap (0.1, 0.0) to reduce contention
- Test with larger key pool (500-1000) to spread load
- Consider testing with LocalStack for faster iteration
- Measure S3 operation latency separately

## Serialization Verification

Added `verify_serializable_isolation()` function that:
1. ‚úÖ Reads final snapshot (txn_id, segment_seq)
2. ‚úÖ Scans all entries in manifest
3. ‚úÖ Checks for duplicate keys (ensures no conflicting writes succeeded)
4. ‚úÖ Verifies transaction ID monotonicity
5. ‚úÖ Confirms all successful writes are reflected

This ensures the serializable isolation guarantee holds under concurrent workload.

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Immediate Priorities

   - Increase key pool to 500-1000
   - Test with more writers (4, 8, 16)

2. **CSV Export Implementation**:
   - Add CSV export to `metrics.rs`
   - Export results for each test run
   - Prepare for visualization

3. **Parameter Sweeps**:
   - Sweep num_writers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
   - Sweep writer_rate: 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0
   - Sweep key_overlap_ratio: 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0
   - Find the "10% precondition failure threshold"

4. **Additional Verification**:
   - Add more detailed S3 segment inspection
   - Verify segment ordering matches transaction order
   - Check for orphan segments after test completion

## Conclusion

Phase 1 is **complete and successful**. The foundation for chaos testing is solid:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive tracing for debugging
- ‚úÖ Flexible workload generator
- ‚úÖ Accurate metrics collection
- ‚úÖ Real S3 integration
- ‚úÖ Serialization verification

The baseline test demonstrates that serializable isolation is working correctly, with precondition failures preventing conflicting writes. The high failure rate (45.83%) is expected given the configuration and validates that the CAS-based concurrency control is functioning as designed.

Ready to proceed to Phase 2: parameter sweeps and optimization.
